The DSP network adjusts the phase and time delay of each acoustic component to eliminate acoustic phase cancellations and maximize output in the crossover region for truer-to-life sound. The DSP network also provides the necessary EQ and gain adjustment to blend the two acoustic components together seamlessly. Beautifully designed for shelf or rack mount applications, the Klipsch Jubilee active crossover also features adjustable low frequency and high frequency trim levels to ensure the ultimate listening experience tailored to your room and personal taste.\n\nHIGH EFFICIENCY, HIGH PERFORMANCE LOUDSPEAKER The Klipsch Jubilee is a fully-horn loaded two-way loudspeaker, designed to deliver the ultimate listening experience. The Klipsch Jubilee incorporates the latest in acoustic developments to accomplish this feat, featuring a patented horn-loaded vented low frequency enclosure and an all-new horn-loaded compression driver. Each component is specifically optimized to operate in its individual pass-band, resulting in the Klipsch Jubilee being one of the most efficient commercially available loudspeakers. Higher efficiency yields greater acoustic power, which is generated with considerably less effort. The result is the cleanest, most dynamic sound possible throughout the entire musical range. \n\nPATENTED HORN-LOADED VENTED SYSTEM The patented low frequency enclosure of the Klipsch Jubilee is designed to provide magnificent presence, by leveraging the efficiencies of both horn-loaded and vented systems. The typical vented system already increases the efficiency and sensitivity for extended low frequency performance. Horn-loading this system allows the Klipsch Jubilee to be a staggering 10 to 20 times more efficient than a conventional loudspeaker. This results in unrivaled low frequency performance, maximizing output while minimizing distortion, for dynamic and clean bass",

        "description": "THE MOST VERSATILE KLIPSCH CREATION\nOriginally designed for professional use, the Klipsch La Scala has proven itself as an outstanding choice for the audiophile as well. The La Scala brings the most subtle musical details to life, always delivering the legendary Klipsch sound with clarity and ease. On a single watt, it generates 105 decibels of sound pressure, which means that the La Scala will delight the listener even while using the most modest amplifier power\n\nNEODYMIUM TWEETER\nThe La Scala features a neodymium tweeter with a 1\u201d polyimide diaphragm and\ncopper clad aluminium voice coil. This lightweight diaphragm assembly and high\nstrength magnet structure creates the tweeter\u2019s high 105dB sensitivity and makes\nit the most efficient consumer tweeter in the market. When coupled to a 90\u00b0 x\n40\u00b0 Tractrix\u00ae horn, the tweeter sets new levels of performance for dynamic range\nand output.\nMIDRANGE\nAccording to Paul W. Klipsch, \u201cthe midrange is where we live\u201d and is one of the\nmost critical parts in any loudspeaker design. The La Scala\u2019s midrange utilizes\na 2\u201d compression driver mated to a high efficiency exponential horn that\nmaximizes the system\u2019s power and performance. As a result, less distortion is\nproduced by the amplifier and by the loudspeaker. That means clarity, accuracy\nand remarkable tonal definition.\nBOOK-MATCHED WOOD VENEER\nKlipsch only uses book-matched wood veneers for the Heritage series. The\nveneer leaves are kept in order as they are delicately sliced from the timber and\nprecisely arranged to provide a mirror image at the splice joint \u2014 like turning\nthe pages of a book. This gives each speaker an aesthetically appealing and\nconsistent appearance that is treasured more than any other cut of wood veneer\nThe LF and HF cabinets are also matched for continuous grain and colour from top\nto bottom.",
