The barrier is designed and manufactured with a casting process, so the parts are previsioned accurately and hence the stability of the barrier gate is assured. Boom gates are typically found at level crossings, drawbridges, parking facilities, checkpoints, and entrances to restricted areas. The boom barrier is aesthetically designed with a sleek and modern look. The articulated boom is designed for heavy usage in the parking industry and ensures a hassle-free operation for many years. Smooth boom movement with automatic slowdown. It has a 90\u00b0 articulated boom mechanism. Maximum boom Length can go up to 5m.",

        "description": "Although technology offers variety of control systems, barriers remain the most convenient and the simplest solution to control parking access. Barriers with skirtings 2m each along boom length are ideal for preventing pedestrians, from getting underneath automatic barrier. Aspecial articulated boom consists of two parts for an overall length of 3m with rubber anti-shock protective edges. The cast aluminium joint, which markedly reduces the height during opening, makes it ideal for use in installations such as underground or basement car parking areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Station Push Button Mounted on wall or column in the vicinity of barrier with \u201cOpen / Emergency-Stop / Close\u201d controls. Plastic housing IP 65\n\n\n\n\nTraffic Light / Flashing Light They serve safety requirements & give visual signals for opening and closing impulse\n\n\n\n\nPhotocells The photocells are the safety sensors used to monitor the passageway in 2 different ways a) For safety, the boom will not be allowed to close as long on the IR boom is interrupted. b) While closing of boom if obstacle is detected, the boom will reopen automatically.\n\n\n\n\nKey Selector Mounted on walls or columns in the vicinity of barrier with metal front, plastic back casing is ideal for unauthorised operations due to sleek lock arrangement & designated key.\n\n\n\n\nFixed Support / Mobile Support The barrier bar normally rests on fixed support to be installed on the ground. It can also rest on mobile support attached with the bar, which moves along with the bar and useful when two barriers are installed in opposite locations to cover large openings.\n\n\n\n\nMagnetic Loop Detector Barrier automatically opens when a vehicle goes over the sensor fitted to the pavement. As a safety system, it detects the vehicle going past it and stops the bar from closing until the vehicle has gone through.",

        "description": "Key Components of an Electric Fence\na) Energizer : The heart of an electric fence system is the energizer, also known as the fence charger. It converts power from a mains source or a battery into short but potent pulses of electricity. Energizers are available in various sizes and power options to suit different requirements.\n\nb) Insulators : Insulators are used to support the electrified wires and prevent them from contacting conductive materials, such as fence posts or trees. They ensure that the electric current remains confined to the wires, enhancing the fence's overall efficiency.\n\nc) Wires : Electric fences typically consist of multiple wires, usually made of high-tensile steel or aluminum. These wires are strategically placed at different heights to create a barrier that is difficult to breach. The number and spacing of wires can be adjusted based on the specific security needs.\n\nd) Posts : Fence posts are essential for providing support and structure to the electric fence. They can be made of wood, metal, or plastic, depending on the desired durability and conductivity.\n\ne) Grounding : Proper grounding is critical for an electric fence to function effectively. Grounding rods are buried in the ground near the fence, providing a path for the electric current to complete its circuit. This ensures a consistent and reliable electrical pulse throughout the fence.",
